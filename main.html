	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity measures how efficient an algorithm is by analyzing how the running time grows with input size. Writing efficient code helps improve performance and scalability.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution, and in many cases it can be represented using O(n) notation based on input size.
